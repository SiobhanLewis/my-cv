    title: 353
    intro: |
        When i was 17 years old I lost my eldest brother, Conrad, in Afghanistan. 
        He was the 353rd soldier to lose his life. I was determined to ensure 
        this wasn't the end and in fact a new beginning, and thus, the 353 Charitable 
        Trust was born. Having researched the competitive landscape I devised the brand,
        its values and its identity. The main aim of 353 is to generate income that can be
        reinvested into existing charities to help the injured, the fallen and their 
        families. Since 2011, the 353 Charitable Trust has successfully built a worth of 
        just shy of 1 million pounds. Within my work for the charity I have learned how to 
        apply a number of marketing techniques to successfully harness the power of both 
        online and offline media.
        <br/><br/>
        My most recent work has been regarding the launch of the ‘The
        Lost Boys of Quadrat’ online and physical diary (diary.353.org.uk).
        The physical copy of the diary is extra special, just like everything
        353 aims to achieve. There are two forms of the diary. Alongside
        a generic copy, the second was created to be an 'extra special'
        investment purchase, with only 100 made. The casing of the
        diary was made by men and women in Afghanistan and shipped
        to the UK. The casing contains a handmade dog-tag, identical to
        that of Conrad's as well as an empty shell casing used in Afghan.
        The diary itself is printed with ink containing the blood of soldiers
        from the Parachute Regiment who served along side Conrad.
        The creative idea was to produce something that allowed people
        to be as close to the front line mentally, whilst they were reading
        the incredibly truthful and heartfelt diary of Pte.C.Burtenshaw.
